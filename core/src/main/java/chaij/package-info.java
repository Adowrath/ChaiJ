/**
 * This is the main package of ChaiJ, a unit test assertion
 * library written in the expect-style of chai, a JavaScript
 * assertion library this project is modeled after.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link chaij.ChaiJ} for a start on how to get yourself an expectation.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this style also allows for running multiple consecutive
 * checks in one unit test, i.e. a non-fail-fast testing style.
 *
 * <p>
 * For JUnit integration, see the {@code chaij-junit} artifact.

 * @since 0.0.1
